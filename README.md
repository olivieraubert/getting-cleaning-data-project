# Project

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:
- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
- From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each   subject.


# Script and Data

- run_analysis.R contains all the code to perform the analyses described in the 5 steps. 
- They can be launched in RStudio by just importing the file
- The output of the 5th step is called average_variable_for_each_subject.txt, and uploaded in the course project's form.
